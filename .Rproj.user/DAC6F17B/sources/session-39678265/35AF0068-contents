abstract: "This paper considers the decentralized (discrete)
optimal transport (D-OT) problem. In this setting, a
network of agents seeks to design a transportation plan
jointly, where the cost function is the sum of privately
held costs for each agent. Therefore, no agent has access
to the total costs of a transport plan. We reformulate the
D-OT problem as a constraint-coupled optimization problem
and propose a single-loop decentralized algorithm with an
iteration complexity of O(1/ε) that matches existing
centralized first-order approaches. Moreover, we propose
the decentralized equitable optimal transport (DE-OT)
problem. In DE-OT, in addition to cooperatively designing a
transportation plan that minimizes transportation costs,
agents seek to ensure equity in their individual transport
costs. The iteration complexity of the proposed method to
solve DE-OT is also shown to be O(1/ε). This rate
improves existing centralized
algorithms, where the best iteration complexity obtained is
O(1/ε^2)."
