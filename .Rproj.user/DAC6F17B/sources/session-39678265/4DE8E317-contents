## About Me
I am a first year Ph.D. student in the 
[Department of Computer Science](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/)
at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), advised by 
[Jonathan Scarlett](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/). 
My research interests lie in the theoretical aspects of machine learning,
with a particular focus on developing algorithms for decision-making in 
sequential and low-resource environments. 
Before joining NUS, I was in the 
[Electrical and Computer Engineering Ph.D. program](https://eceweb.rice.edu/academics/graduate-programs/phd-program) 
at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) (August 2022 - December 2023). 
I hold an M.Sc. in Mathematics from 
[Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) (2021) and a B.Sc. in 
Computer Science and Mathematics from the 
[University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) (2019).
