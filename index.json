In this setting, a network of agents seeks to design a transportation plan jointly, where the cost function is the sum of privately held costs for each agent. Therefore, no agent has access to the total costs of a transport plan. We reformulate the D-OT problem as a constraint-coupled optimization problem and propose a single-loop decentralized algorithm with an iteration complexity of O(1/ε) that matches existing centralized first-order approaches. Moreover, we propose the decentralized equitable optimal transport (DE-OT) problem. In DE-OT, in addition to cooperatively designing a transportation plan that minimizes transportation costs, agents seek to ensure equity in their individual transport costs. The iteration complexity of the proposed method to solve DE-OT is also shown to be O(1/ε). This rate improves existing centralized algorithms, where the best iteration complexity obtained is O(1/ε^2).","tags":null,"title":"Decentralized and Equitable Optimal Transport","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

Whenever a new arm is requested from a given group, its mean reward is drawn from an unknown reservoir distribution (different for each group), and the uncertainty in the arm’s mean reward can only be reduced via subsequent pulls of the arm. The goal is to identify the infinite-arm group whose reservoir distribution has the highest (1−α)-quantile (e.g., median if α=1/2), using as few total arm pulls as possible. We introduce a two-step algorithm that first requests a fixed number of arms from each group and then runs a finite-arm grouped max-quantile bandit algorithm. We characterize both the instance-dependent and worst-case regret, and provide a matching lower bound for the latter, while discussing various strengths, weaknesses, algorithmic improvements, and potential lower bounds associated with our instance-dependent upper bounds.","tags":null,"title":"Max-Quantile Grouped Infinite-Arm Bandits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan Lau","Jonathan Scarlett","Yang Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672185600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672185600,"objectID":"4b0e309c1ae9a25799f8f631e6af2383","permalink":"https://ivanphlau.github.io/publication/model_based_gt/","publishdate":"2022-12-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/model_based_gt/","section":"publication","summary":"The goal of the group testing problem is to identify a set of defective items within a larger set of items, using suitably-designed tests whose outcomes indicate whether any defective item is present. In this paper, we study how the number of tests can be significantly decreased by leveraging the structural dependencies between the items, i.e., by incorporating prior information. To do so, we pursue two different perspectives: (i) As a generalization of the uniform combinatorial prior, we consider the case that the defective set is uniform over a subset of all possible sets of a given size, and study how this impacts the information-theoretic limits on the number of tests for approximate recovery; (ii) As a generalization of the i.i.d. prior, we introduce a new class of priors based on the Ising model, where the associated graph represents interactions between items. We show that this naturally leads to an Integer Quadratic Program decoder, which can be converted to an Integer Linear Program and/or relaxed to a non-integer variant for improved computational complexity, while maintaining strong empirical recovery performance.","tags":null,"title":"Model-Based and Graph-Based Priors for Group Testing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan Lau","Jonathan Jedwab"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1626048000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626048000,"objectID":"016d384510537544129a379f5ae96393","permalink":"https://ivanphlau.github.io/publication/near_optimal_cs/","publishdate":"2021-07-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/near_optimal_cs/","section":"publication","summary":"An efficient compressed sensing scheme requires a small number of measurements, a fast recovery algorithm, a small approximation error, and little or no randomness.

Since its original proposal for syphilis screening, group testing has been applied in domains such as fault identification in electrical and computer networks, machine learning, data mining, and cryptography. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to proposals for using group testing in its original context of identifying infected individuals in a population with few tests. Studies suggest that nonadaptive group testing - in which all the tests are determined in advance - for SARS-CoV-2 could help save 20% to 90% of tests depending on the prevalence. However, no systematic approach for comparing different non-adaptive group testing strategies currently exists. In this paper we develop a software platform for evaluating non-adaptive group testing strategies in both a noiseless setting and in the presence of realistic noise sources, modelled on published experimental observations, which makes them applicable to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, the dominant type of tests for SARS-CoV-2. This modular platform can be used with a variety of group testing designs and decoding algorithms. We use it to evaluate the performance of near-doubly-regular designs and a decoding algorithm based on an integer linear programming formulation, both of which are known to be optimal in some regimes. We find savings between 40% and 91% of tests for prevalences up to 10% when a small error (below 5%) is allowed. We also find that the performance degrades gracefully with noise. We expect our modular, user-friendly, publicly available platform to facilitate empirical research into non-adaptive group testing for SARS-CoV-2.","tags":null,"title":"Group Testing Large Populations for SARS-CoV-2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan Lau","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
